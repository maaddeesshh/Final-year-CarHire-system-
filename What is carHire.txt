It can be difficult to find relocation automobile owner providers. As a result, the majority of consumers continue to employ subpar service providers simply because they are unable to find another. This was resolved by proposing and completing a project to ensure that the process of finding service providers was made simpler.
It is possible to visit this project's web application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Through it, any consumer can look for their desired moving vehicle, submit a hire request, and wait for the service provider's response. The client can get in touch with the service provider as well. When a group is assigned, the user must log in. Contacting the service provider requires action outside of the app.  The 'always busy' nature of service providers and potential delays led to this being favoured. To increase security, an email with a service code is given to both the owner and the client after a hire is approved.
The project's major goal was to close the gap between the service provider and the client in order to cut out any middlemen and give the client a range of options. Additionally, it was designed to give customers the freedom to remark on their experiences with service providers and score them.
The project is built using the Django, a python framework and runs on SQLite database backend. It can handle as many users as possible without crashing. It is developed following the unified process methodology while borrowing a few concepts from the SDLC methodology.
